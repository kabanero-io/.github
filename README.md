# Goodbye Kabanero

## Development of Kabanero as a Standalone Project Ended

The kabanero project was created in 2019 to complement the Appsody project. It added continuous integration and continuous delivery using Tekton pipelines.
Since the development effort in [Appsody ceased](https://appsody.dev/blogs/DevelopmentEnded), it is time for Kabanero to follow. 

The ideas behind Appsody and the development efforts were combined with odo into [odo 2.0](https://odo.dev).  For odo based continuous integration and continuous delivery experience, use [OpenShift Gitops](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cicd/gitops/gitops-release-notes.html), 
which is based on ArgoCD and [kam](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam), a command line interface to set up gitops pipelines.

The repositories associated with Kabanero-io will be archived shortly.
